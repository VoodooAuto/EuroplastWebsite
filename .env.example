# Database Configuration (not needed for Netlify demo)
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

# For production deployment with real database:
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/database

# Netlify automatically handles environment variables through their dashboard
# This demo uses static data and doesn't require a database connection
